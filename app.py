# Capital Budgeting Dashboard

This application helps you manage your budget by comparing your planned spending (budget) with your actual expenses.  It provides visual summaries and alerts to help you identify areas where you might be overspending.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Budgeting:** Creating a financial plan that outlines expected income and expenses.
*   **Variance Analysis:** Comparing budgeted amounts to actual amounts to identify deviations.
*   ****Percentage Variance:**** The variance as a percentage of the budgeted amount.
*   **Trend Analysis:** Examining spending patterns over time.

**Mathematical Formulas:**

*   **Variance:**
    $$
    Variance = Actual - Budgeted
    $$
*   **Percentage Variance:**
    $$
    Percentage\\ Variance = \\frac{Actual - Budgeted}{Budgeted} \\times 100
    $$
