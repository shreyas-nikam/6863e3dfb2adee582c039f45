In this lab, we will explore the fundamental concepts of capital budgeting, a crucial aspect of financial management. Capital budgeting involves the process of evaluating potential investment projects to determine which ones are worth pursuing. It helps organizations make informed decisions about allocating resources to projects that will generate the highest returns and contribute to the company's long-term profitability.

We will cover several key techniques used in capital budgeting, including:

*   **Net Present Value (NPV):**  NPV is a method used to determine the current value of all future cash flows generated by a project, discounted by a required rate of return.
    $$
    NPV = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t} - Initial Investment
    $$
    Where:
    *   $CF_t$ = Cash flow in period t
    *   $r$ = Discount rate
    *   $n$ = Number of periods

*   **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows from a particular project equal to zero.
    $$
    0 = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + IRR)^t} - Initial Investment
    $$
    Where:
    *   $CF_t$ = Cash flow in period t
    *   $IRR$ = Internal Rate of Return
    *   $n$ = Number of periods

*   **Payback Period:** The payback period is the amount of time it takes for a project to recover its initial investment.

*   **Discounted Payback Period:** Similar to the payback period, but it considers the time value of money by discounting future cash flows.

This lab will provide you with the tools and knowledge to analyze investment opportunities and make sound capital budgeting decisions.
