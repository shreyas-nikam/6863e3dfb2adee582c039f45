# Mastering Your Budget with the Capital Budgeting Dashboard

## Introduction to Personal Budgeting and the Application
Duration: 0:05:00

Welcome to this codelab on using the Capital Budgeting Dashboard, a simple yet powerful application designed to help you take control of your finances. While the term "Capital Budgeting" often applies to large corporate investment decisions, the core principles of planning, tracking, and analyzing financial performance are equally vital for personal or household finances.

This application brings these principles to your personal budget. It allows you to set spending goals (your budget), track where your money actually goes (your expenses), and then analyze how well you're sticking to your plan. This process is crucial for achieving financial goals, whether it's saving for a down payment, paying off debt, or simply understanding your spending habits.

The application focuses on several key concepts:

*   **Budgeting:** The process of creating a detailed plan of expected income and expenses over a specific period. It's your roadmap for spending and saving.
*   **Variance Analysis:** This is the process of comparing your actual spending to your budgeted amounts. It helps you identify areas where you spent more or less than planned.
*   **Variance:** The difference between what you actually spent and what you budgeted. A positive variance means you spent less than budgeted (or earned more than budgeted, though this app focuses on expenses), while a negative variance means you spent more than budgeted.
    $$
    Variance = Actual - Budgeted
    $$
*   **Percentage Variance:** Expresses the variance as a percentage of your original budget. This helps you understand the *magnitude* of the deviation relative to the budget amount.
    $$
    Percentage\\ Variance = \\frac{Actual - Budgeted}{Budgeted} \\times 100
    $$
*   **Trend Analysis:** Looking at your spending patterns over time to identify how expenses in specific categories might be changing.

By the end of this codelab, you will be able to use this dashboard to set up your budget, track your expenses, and analyze your spending habits effectively.

## Navigating the Application and Inputting Your Budget
Duration: 0:05:00

The Capital Budgeting Dashboard is structured into three main sections, accessible via the sidebar on the left.

1.  **Budget Input:** This is where you define your spending categories and how much you plan to spend in each.
2.  **Expense Tracking:** This is where you log each individual expense as it occurs.
3.  **Summary:** This section provides an overview of your budget performance, comparing your planned spending to your actual spending, and showing trends.

<aside class="positive">
To begin, make sure the **Budget Input** option is selected in the sidebar.
</aside>

On the **Budget Input** page, you will find a form to add your budget categories and the planned amount for each.

*   In the "Category Name" field, enter the name of a spending category you want to track (e.g., "Groceries", "Rent", "Utilities", "Entertainment").
*   In the "Budgeted Amount" field, enter the amount you plan to spend in this category for the period you are tracking (e.g., monthly).
*   Click the "Add/Update Category" button.

You can add as many categories as you need. If you enter a category name that already exists, entering a new amount will update the budget for that category.

<aside class="positive">
As you add categories, they will appear in the "Current Budget Plan" table below the form. Review this table to ensure your budget is entered correctly.
</aside>

Once you have entered all your budget categories and amounts, you've completed the first step: setting your financial plan.

## Logging Your Expenses
Duration: 0:05:00

Now that your budget is set, the next step is to track your actual spending.

<aside class="positive">
Switch to the **Expense Tracking** page using the sidebar navigation.
</aside>

On this page, you will log each expense as it happens. You'll see a form with a few fields:

*   **Category:** Use the dropdown menu to select the budget category that this expense belongs to. The options in this dropdown come directly from the categories you defined in the "Budget Input" step.

<aside class="negative">
If you haven't added any categories in the Budget Input page, the dropdown will be empty, and you won't be able to log expenses. Make sure to set up your budget categories first!
</aside>

*   **Date:** Select the date the expense occurred using the date picker.
*   **Expense Amount:** Enter the amount of money you spent.

After filling in the details for an expense, click the "Log Expense" button.

<aside class="positive">
Each logged expense will be added to the "Logged Expenses" table below the form. This table provides a running list of all the individual transactions you have recorded.
</aside>

Log your expenses consistently over your budgeting period (e.g., a week or a month) to get an accurate picture of your spending.

## Reviewing the Summary and Analyzing Performance
Duration: 0:05:00

With your budget defined and expenses logged, you can now analyze your performance against your plan.

<aside class="positive">
Select the **Summary** page from the sidebar.
</aside>

This page automatically pulls together your budget data and your logged expenses to provide a comprehensive overview.

First, you'll see the **"Budget and Expenses Comparison"** table. This table shows each budget category alongside:

*   **Budgeted:** The amount you planned to spend (from the Budget Input page).
*   **Amount:** The total actual amount spent in this category (calculated by summing up all logged expenses for this category).
*   **Variance:** The difference between Budgeted and Actual ($Budgeted - Actual$).
*   **Percent Variance:** The variance as a percentage of the budgeted amount.

<aside class="positive">
A positive Variance indicates you spent less than budgeted for that category (a surplus). A negative Variance indicates you spent more than budgeted (a deficit or overspending).
</aside>

Below the table, a bar chart titled **"Budget vs. Actual Spending"** visually compares your budgeted amount against your actual spending for each category. This makes it easy to quickly see where your spending aligned with your budget and where it differed significantly.

The application also highlights categories where you have overspent:

*   The **"Over-spent in the following categories:"** section lists any categories where your Variance is negative (meaning Actual spending exceeded Budgeted spending). This serves as an important alert.

Finally, for each category where you have logged expenses, the application displays a line chart showing the **spending trend** over time. This can help you identify patterns, like whether expenses in a certain category are increasing, decreasing, or are consistent.

Use the Summary page to understand your spending habits, identify areas where you might need to adjust your budget, or celebrate sticking to your plan!
